## Data Collection Strategy

**Primary Data Sources:**
- **FRED API**: Pull the key HICP indices (CP96EAMM, CP96DEMM) and related economic indicators
- **BLS API**: Complement with US travel/leisure data for comparative analysis
- **Eurostat**: Direct API calls for additional EU tourism statistics
- **ECB**: Monetary policy indicators that might influence travel spending

**Secondary Indicators to Consider:**
- Air passenger traffic data
- Hotel occupancy rates
- Consumer confidence indices
- Exchange rates (EUR/USD, EUR/GBP)
- Oil prices (travel cost proxy)
- GDP growth rates for key EU countries

## Polars-Centric Data Pipeline

**Data Architecture:**
- Use Polars lazy evaluation for efficient data processing across multiple time series
- Create a unified schema for all HICP series with country identifiers
- Implement rolling window calculations for seasonal adjustments
- Build a feature store with lagged variables and derived indicators

**Key Polars Advantages:**
- Fast time series operations for seasonal decomposition
- Efficient cross-country joins and comparisons
- Memory-efficient handling of multiple vintage datasets
- Superior performance for feature engineering at scale

## Analytical Framework

**Seasonal Adjustment Approach:**
1. **X-13ARIMA-SEATS equivalent** using statsmodels + Polars
2. **STL decomposition** for trend/seasonal/residual components
3. **Custom seasonal factors** based on booking patterns and school holidays
4. **Cross-country seasonal correlation analysis**

**Forecasting Methodology:**
- **Ensemble approach**: Combine multiple models for robustness
- **ARIMA/SARIMA**: Classical time series for baseline
- **Machine learning**: Random Forest/XGBoost with engineered features
- **Cross-country spillover models**: VAR/Panel VAR for EU dynamics
- **Regime-switching models**: Account for crisis periods (COVID, economic shocks)

## Feature Engineering Strategy

**Temporal Features:**
- Month/quarter dummies for seasonality
- School holiday calendars across EU countries
- Weather indices (temperature, sunshine hours)
- Economic calendar events (ECB meetings, policy announcements)

**Cross-Country Features:**
- Relative price differentials between countries
- Tourism flow matrices (German tourists to Spain, etc.)
- Economic convergence indicators
- Currency volatility measures

## Visualization and Analysis Plan

**Plotly Dashboard Components:**
- **Interactive time series plots** with country comparisons
- **Seasonal heatmaps** showing MoM patterns by country/year
- **Correlation matrices** between countries and leading indicators
- **Forecast confidence intervals** with scenario analysis
- **Residual diagnostics** and model performance metrics

**Jupyter Notebook Structure:**
1. **Data Collection & Cleaning** (FRED/BLS API integration)
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis** (Polars + Plotly)
3. **Seasonal Adjustment** (Custom implementation)
4. **Feature Engineering** (Cross-country indicators)
5. **Model Development** (Multiple approaches)
6. **Forecasting & Validation** (July 2025 projection)
7. **Sensitivity Analysis** (Scenario testing)

## Model Validation Approach

**Backtesting Strategy:**
- **Out-of-sample validation**: Hold out 2023-2024 data
- **Rolling window forecasts**: Simulate real-time forecasting
- **Cross-country validation**: Train on some countries, test on others
- **Seasonal robustness tests**: Focus on summer months specifically

## Key Challenges to Address

**Data Quality Issues:**
- Missing data imputation using cross-country relationships
- Handling structural breaks (COVID, Brexit, energy crises)
- Dealing with different seasonal patterns across countries

**Methodological Considerations:**
- Choosing appropriate seasonal adjustment parameters
- Balancing model complexity vs. interpretability
- Incorporating expert judgment and market intelligence
- Handling the high volatility of package holiday prices
